"<hr><h4>General information</h4             <p>Boot Environments are "
"bootable clones of snapshots of the working system.             Before "
"upgrading or making major changes to the system, it is strongly recommended "
"that you create a safe boot environment to recover after a failure "
"occurs.             Note that Boot Environments by default may not cover all "
